            <h3>GETTING STARTED <span class="caret"></span></h3>
            <span>
            <p>BIA School is focused mainly on building and preparing our learners to be able to gain grounds in the world that awaits them. To be able to standout and make a difference. The senior classes are prepared to partake in external exams and we have recorded an outstanding success in these few years. As an international school, we are happy to provide our learners with the highest possible standard of education, enabling them to compete in an increasingly competitive global environment.</p>
            <p>The need to maintain this standard demand not just in teaching methods which are appropriate to the needs of our learners but that those learners, in turn, are able to demonstrate that they have the potential or ability to achieve the levels we require. Admission is not based on ethnic, religion or creed. It's all based on merits. Admission is at school discretion and the schol's decision is final. Only if a students fails to show basic understanding, or shows a lack of potential will they be refused admission.</p></span>

                    School examination results are clearly indicated on the students' reports, so parents are fully aware of their child's progress.

Parents partnership are key to a successful experience for their children and for them to gain the most out of their early education and reach expected levels of development. This responsibility usually falls to the teacher to ensure an effective relationship is built and share information at the beginning and end of the day, reason why the open day is important so cogent issues can be discussed.
            </p>
